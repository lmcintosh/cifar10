This is a git repo for caffe-driven convolutional neural network models trained on CIFAR10.  For CS431 High-level vision class project.

Generally the common advice about convolutional neural networks is "bigger is better."  In this project, we ask where is the best place to allocate additional computational resources in a convolutional neural network.
